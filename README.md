# Homelab Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for my homelab setup. This repository contains detailed documentation of the physical and virtual infrastructure, network configurations, and services running in the homelab environment.

## Contents

- [Network](docs/network.md) - Detailed network design, including VLANs, subnets, and firewall rules.
- [Hardware](docs/hardware.md) - An overview of the physical servers and network gear.
- [Services](docs/services.md) - A list of services running in the homelab.
- [DNS Strategy](docs/dns.md) - The DNS resolution strategy for the network.

This documentation is actively maintained and will be updated as the homelab evolves.
