# Homelab Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for my homelab setup. This repository contains detailed documentation of the physical and virtual infrastructure, network configurations, and services running in the homelab environment.

## Contents

- [Network Documentation](docs/network.md) - Physical network devices with Mermaid visualizations and descriptions.
- [Physical Hosts](docs/physicalhosts.md) - Physical machines with descriptions and diagrams.

Additional documentation files will be added to this repository as the homelab evolves.
