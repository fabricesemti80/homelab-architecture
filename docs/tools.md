# Tools

This is just a small - arbitrary hand picked - list of tools I use.

## Terraform / Opentofu

Mainly mentioning here some providers I am using.

- [OnePassword provider](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/1password/onepassword/v2.1.2)
- [Unifi provider](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/filipowm/unifi/latest)

## Ansible

- [OnePassword lookup](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/onepassword_lookup.html)

## 1Password

For details on how 1Password is integrated into the automation workflow, see the [1Password Usage Guide](tools/1password_usage.md).
